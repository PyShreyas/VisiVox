# 📚 Python Libraries Used in VisiVox - Assistive Vision and Voice Robot

1. opencv-python           # For image capture, processing, and drawing bounding boxes
2. pytesseract             # OCR engine wrapper to extract text from images
3. pyttsx3                 # Offline Text-to-Speech conversion
4. serial (pyserial)       # Serial communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano
5. time                    # For delays and timestamping events
6. os                      # OS-level file/path operations
7. numpy                   # Image array manipulations and sensor data handling
8. PIL (Pillow)            # Image handling and format conversions
9. imutils                 # Simplified OpenCV operations (resizing, centering, etc.)
10. threading              # Running TTS and sensor reads asynchronously

# 📈 Libraries for Graph Construction and Data Visualization

11. matplotlib             # For plotting distance graphs, detection logs, etc.
12. seaborn                # Enhanced plots and visual styling (built on matplotlib)
13. pandas                 # Managing tabular data and generating plots
14. plotly                 # (Optional) Interactive graphs and dashboards

# 🗃️ Data Logging and Storage

15. sqlite3                # Local database storage for text logs, obstacle events, and timestamps
